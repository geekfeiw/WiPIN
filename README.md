# WiPIN

The codes include implementation of Butterworth filter, iFFT/FFT, feature extraction and normalization, training/test, and prediction confidences computation.

LIBLINEAR is an SVM tool that outputs the model weights, i.e., *w*, with *w*, prediction confidences can be computed.
Official site is [here](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/). To install it in MATLAB via [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15559516).


Some other tools used in WiPIN:
Linear Discriminant Analysis or PCA tool can be found [here](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/drtoolbox/).
Support Vector Regression tool, i.e., LIBSVM, can be found [hear](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/)(this cannot compute prediction scores).
